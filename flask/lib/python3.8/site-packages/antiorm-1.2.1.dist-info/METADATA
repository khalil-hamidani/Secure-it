Anti-ORM is not an ORM, and it certainly does not want to be.  Anti-ORM is a
simple Python module that provides a pythonic syntax for making it more
convenient to build SQL queries over the DBAPI-2.0 interface.

In practice, if you're the kind of person that likes it to the bare metal, it's
almost as good as the ORMs.  At least there is no magic, and it just works.
