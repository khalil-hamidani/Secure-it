## Description

Secure it is a cybersecurity web application that provides several features to help users protect their online accounts and data.

One of the main features of Secure it is the ability to **Encrypt** and **Decrypt** messages using the [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). This allows users to send encrypted messages to each other, which can only be decrypted by someone who knows the correct shift value.

Secure It also includes a **Password Generator**, which can be used to create strong, random passwords for online accounts. Users can specify the length and complexity of the password, and the generator will generate a secure password that meets these requirements.

In addition to the password generator, Secure It also includes a **Password Manager** feature. This allows users to store their login credentials for different online accounts in a secure location.

Overall, Secure It is a useful tool for users who want to protect their online accounts and data by using strong passwords and encrypted communication.

## Tools

- **HTML** : used to define the structure and layout of a web page, including the text, images, and other media that it contains.
- **CSS** : used to control the appearance of elements on a web page, including the colors, fonts, layout, and other visual properties.
- **JavaScript** : used to build interactive elements on web pages and the main function of the web application.
- **Python** :(**Flask framework**) used as the backend for web applications, meaning that it runs on a server and handles the server-side logic and processing for the app.
- **SQL** : used as a database management system for the application.

## Implementation

The app is structured using HTML elements to define the layout and content of the various pages , there are 11 html Files stored in the templates folder for the whole project: `index.html` for the landing page , `login.html` and `register.html` for login and register forms and `encryption.html`, `decryption.html`, `passwordGen.html`, `passwordMan.html` for the main features of the the app. `user.html`, `bad.html` for showing the user account and error messages, and finally the `template.html` is the file where all the previous files are extended from it using the **jinja2** syntax

CSS is used to style the app, including the layout, fonts, colors, and other visual elements all inside `styles.css` file in the static folder.

JavaScript is used to implement the core functionality of the app, including the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption algorithms in the `encryption.js` and `decryption.js` files one the static folder, the password generator, and the password manager in the `passGen.js` and `passMan.js`.

Data is stored and retrieved from a backend server with database using Flask: `app.py` is the main python script that allwos users to sign in , log in and store there passwords inside the datatbase stored in `secure.db`
